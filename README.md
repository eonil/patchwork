Patchwork
=========
2021, Eonil.

Minimal declarative layout library for UIKit.

[![CI](https://github.com/eonil/patchwork/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/eonil/patchwork/actions/workflows/main.yml)


Why?
----
SwiftUI is working, but still has numerous problems. Especially with layout errors.
It also lacks too much features, I still need to depend on UIKit heavily.
Apple is going to fix them eventualy, but I can't wait for it.
I need something right now, that works flawlessly with UIKit and does not spit any layout error. 
`Patchwork` is for that needs.


Subset
------
This does not aim to provide full features of UIKit or SwiftUI.
This aims very small portion of the frameworks -- static information layout.
Composition of space, color, text, image, button, stack and list.
